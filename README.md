# PCiunkiewicz

Hi there! I’m Phil, Lead Data Scientist at Trufla Technology and a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Calgary. My research focuses on machine reasoning for risk determination and decision support in biomedical systems. I’m passionate about education, scientific communication, and outreach. When I’m not studying or working, I enjoy mountain biking, climbing, hiking, snowboarding, and learning about new and random fields.
